methods:>display,set
set method is used to intilize a class_attributes
display method is used to print/display the object
constructor :intialize instance variable along with the creation of object 
c++,java=>constructor name is always class_name
javascript =>constructor name is constructor()
static variable->binds with class ,if there is a common attribute in a class
instance variable-> binds with object ->object inside access (self) outside 
local variable-usual attributes in a class
python => constructor is __init__
constructor  will calls along with the creation of object
__str__ ->object string representation 
__class__ -> to identify which class object

polymorphisum -> 1:method overloading
              -> 2:method  overriding
self ->refers to current class

Abstraction ->hides implementation details
           *Abstract class
           *Abstract method
